# Working with network data


## Summary

This repository provides materials for a session that is part of the [I2DS Tools for Data Science workshop](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22-workshop) run at the [Hertie School, Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in November 2022. The student-run workshop is part of the course [Introduction to Data Science](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-22) taught by Simon Munzert at the Hertie School, Berlin, in Fall 2022.

### Session contents

This session will introduce you to network analysis using {tidygraph} and {ggraph}. We'll show you the basic theory behind graph theory and, then, apply those concepts to the packages' main functions. In the end, we'll show you a real-life example, based on Hertie School's twitter account, showing how to apply those tools in concrete.

### Main learning objectives

The goals of this session are to (1) present you a general understanding about graph theory, (2) present the basic workflow of a network analysis, (3) show you how to integrate tidyverse, tidygraph and ggraph and (4) give you further reference.

## Statement of contributions

Both instructors prepared together the material, the videos and the concepts behind the presentation.

**Radwa Abdelsalam** researched the mathematical concepts behind the package functions, the presentation examples and academic material.

**Rodrigo Dornelles** worked on organizing the package coding and data wrangling for the application examples.
